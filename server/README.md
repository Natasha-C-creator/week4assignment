REFLECTION:

1. Created Trello board just fine. This helped massively as an area to jot down thoughts, things I need to do, and bring structure to the project. It meant I had somewhere to refer back to if I was a bit lost!
2. Had problems with Git (pushing/pulling) so added that to Block until I could seek help. This did mean that I wasn't updating Git regularly with my updates though, so I'll do that differently next time.
